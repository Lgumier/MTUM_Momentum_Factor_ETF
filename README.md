## Overview

This project investigates the performance and characteristics of the **momentum factor** through an in-depth analysis of the [iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239726/ishares-msci-usa-momentum-factor-etf).  
We evaluate return patterns, momentum construction, statistical properties, and historical dynamics, integrating quantitative methods and visual insights.
